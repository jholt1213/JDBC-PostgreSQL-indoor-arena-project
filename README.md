# JDBC-PostgreSQL-indoor-arena-project
Indoor Arena Management System
Java | PostgreSQL | JDBC

Overview
The Indoor Arena Management System is a Java application that processes arena data and stores it in a PostgreSQL relational database. The project demonstrates core skills in Java programming, database design, SQL querying, and JDBC database connectivity.

This project was developed as part of my Application Development and Data Analysis coursework and focuses on building a complete, database-driven application from input to reporting.

Features
- Reads structured arena data and stores it in a PostgreSQL database
- Uses JDBC to connect Java applications to a relational database
- Executes SQL queries to generate reports and summaries
- Demonstrates modular Java design and error handling
- Implements relational database concepts including keys and constraints

Technologies Used
- Java
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC
- SQL
- Git and GitHub

Database Design
The PostgreSQL database was designed to efficiently store and query arena-related data. Key concepts used include relational tables, primary and foreign keys, data normalization, and SQL queries for reporting and analysis.

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/jholt1213/JDBC-PostgreSQL-indoor-arena-project.git
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database locally
3. Update database connection credentials in the Java configuration file
4. Compile and run the Java application
5. View query results generated by the program

What I Learned
- Integrating Java applications with PostgreSQL using JDBC
- Designing relational databases for real-world use cases
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data
- Debugging database connectivity and query issues
- Structuring Java projects for readability and maintainability

Possible Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface
- Expand reporting capabilities
- Improve input validation and error handling
- Support additional data formats
